# Countdown Timer Datapack
Timer pauses automatically when nobody is on the server anymore.

Commands: */function timer:givebook*

I modified an existing Datapack to have way better Time Formatting and includes Hours.
Formatting includes leading zeros and removing hours/minutes if they are zero (see images)
